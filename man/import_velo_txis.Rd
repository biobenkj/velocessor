\usage{
import_velo_txis(cdat, cg, QC = FALSE, asy = "abundance", sep = "_")
}
\arguments{
\item{cdat}{A row of the colData prepared by process_velo_txis.}

\item{cg}{A data.frame with columns 'spliced' and 'unspliced' per gene.}

\item{QC}{Perform rudimentary quality control? (TRUE)}

\item{asy}{What to load into counts/spliced/unspliced? ("abundance")}

\item{sep}{What string separates sample name from barcode? ("_")}
}
\value{
\preformatted{   A SingleCellExperiment with 'spliced' and 'unspliced' assays.
}
}
\description{
This function is usually called by process_velo_txis(). The 'cdat' argument
takes a single-row data.frame containing 'names' and 'files' as its columns.
'cg' is a feature mapping for spliced and unspliced versions of the same
gene (transcript group), as generated by eisaR for tximeta. 'asy' is best
left untouched -- using scaled TPMs ('abundance') works quite well for down-
stream filtering and QC. 'sep' is just the glue for disambiguating cell
barcodes by sample so that they can be merged via cbind without incident
once the results of import_velo_txis are returned to process_velo_txis.
